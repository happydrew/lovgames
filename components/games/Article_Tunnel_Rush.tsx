      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Game Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In Tunnel Rush, you navigate a constantly twisting and turning tunnel filled with various obstacles. The objective is simple yet challenging: steer clear of obstacles for as long as possible while the tunnelâ€™s pace intensifies. The immersive first-person perspective makes you feel as if you're truly racing through a neon-lit, ever-changing environment.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Core Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        The core gameplay of Tunnel Rush is based on endurance and precision. Every collision with an obstacle ends your run, so you must stay alert and react instantly. As you progress, the speed increases, and the obstacles become more varied and unpredictable. Each run is unique due to dynamically generated levels, ensuring that no two games are ever the same.
