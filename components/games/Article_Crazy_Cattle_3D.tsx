                    <li><span className="font-bold">Stay Away from Sheep Clusters:</span> Keep your distance from the herd at the start of the game, when chaos is uncontrollable and sheep will collide causing massive explosions. Entering the fray too early can lead to explosive death. Wait until the herd thins out before joining the battle; typically, the herd quickly reduces to fewer than 10 sheep.</li>
                    <li><span className="font-bold">Avoid Multi-Sheep Battles:</span> Try to avoid engaging in battles with multiple sheep at once. Instead, focus on battling one sheep or a few sheep at a time. This approach increases your chances of winning and reduces the probability of explosion due to random factors.</li>
                    <li><span className="font-bold">Use Terrain Advantages:</span> Learn to use the height differences and various terrain features of the map to gain momentum and strategic advantages.</li>
                    <li><span className="font-bold">Master Basic Movement:</span> In this <strong>3D sheep game</strong>, learning basic movement techniques is the most important first step, ensuring you can accurately control your sheep's direction and speed.</li>

                    <li><span className="font-bold">Develop spatial awareness:</span> Always know where other sheep are when playing <strong>Crazy Catt</strong> online or downloaded.</li>
